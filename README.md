# Rooftop Solar Potential Estimation

This project is designed to estimate the rooftop solar energy potential in a given region using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help identify optimal rooftops for solar panel installation, contributing to sustainable energy initiatives.

## Features

- **Satellite Imagery Processing**: Use of geospatial data for extracting building rooftop images.
- **Machine Learning for Solar Potential**: Trained models to estimate potential solar energy generation.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of results using heatmaps and other graphical tools.
- **Automation**: Scripts to automate the process of rooftop analysis and solar potential estimation.
