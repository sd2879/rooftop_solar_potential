# Rooftop Solar Potential Estimation

This project is designed to estimate the rooftop solar energy potential in a given region using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help identify optimal rooftops for solar panel installation, contributing to sustainable energy initiatives.

## Features

- **Satellite Imagery Processing**: Use of geospatial data for extracting building rooftop images.
- **Machine Learning for Solar Potential**: Trained models to estimate potential solar energy generation.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of results using heatmaps and other graphical tools.
- **Automation**: Scripts to automate the process of rooftop analysis and solar potential estimation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sd2879/rooftop_solar_potential.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rooftop_solar_potential
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the satellite imagery data:

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --data <path_to_data>
   ```

2. Train the machine learning model for solar potential estimation:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py --config config.yaml
   ```

3. Analyze a specific region:

   ```bash
   python analyze_region.py --coordinates <latitude,longitude> --radius <distance_in_km>
   ```

4. Visualize the results:

   ```bash
   python visualize.py --input <path_to_results>
   ```

## Model Details

- **Model Architecture**: Uses a combination of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification and regression to estimate solar potential.
- **Training Data**: Processed from publicly available satellite imagery datasets.

## Results

The model provides a comprehensive analysis of rooftops in the target region, estimating the solar power generation capacity based on various factors like area, orientation, and sunlight exposure.
